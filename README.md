# vacuum_cleaner_robot
This is a 3D printed vacuum cleaner which has all the features that the commercial one has including auto return to home for charging and mapping of the room. The robot's charging dock is also a smart charging dock which guides the robot in alignment with the itself using custom IR codes. It is also internet connected and can be controlled using a mobile app.

This is the second version of the vacuum cleaner robot, I have also made another vacuum cleaner robot which mops the floor. It has an built-in water reservoir and a mop cloth which cleans the floor.
